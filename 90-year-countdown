#  objective: figure out the difference between 90 and 34 (Done)
# how do I calculate the diff in terms of months weeks and days 
# we gonna try to multiply (done)
# Utilize the f sting correctly (done!)

#Write your code below this line ðŸ‘‡
#  so we gonna use number maniuplators and then f-strings 

diff = 90 - int(age)
# the above equation will give me the diff in age. 
# days = 12 * 56
days = diff * 365
weeks = diff *52
months = diff * 12

# number check 
#  so far so good. i used a smaller number (85) to ensure that the math was mathing correctly 
print(f" You have {days} days, {weeks} weeks, and {months} months left.")
